Dear all,

Looking forward to seeing you all at Scientific Python next week.

Please see the following course information: 

https://jhale.github.io/scientific-python/

I would emphasise:
* You must bring a laptop with working WiFi access.
* We will be using Google Colaboratory to execute Python scripts and notebooks
  https://colab.google.com. Please ensure that you can log on before the course
  starts. I will also discuss the best ways to install and use Python on your
  own machine.

Best regards,

Jack Hale
