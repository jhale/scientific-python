# Scientific Python
## Winter Semester 2024/2025
## Master in Mathematics
## Doctoral Programme in Science and Engineering (DSSE)

### Practicalities

Instructor: Jack S. Hale ([jack.hale@uni.lu](mailto:jack.hale@uni.lu)).
Office hours: 1000-1100 Wednesdays, drop-in.

#### Dates

Please see the [ACME](https://acme.uni.lu) system.

#### Teaching units

(Changed) Following the rules set out by the Vice Rectorate for Academic Affairs the
course will be taught as a continuous block of 3 TUs of 45 minutes beginning at
the scheduled start in the ACME system.

### Description

This four session course covers the basics of scientific programming with
Python. It is aimed at people who have done some programming before, perhaps on
an undergraduate course, but need a refresher before starting their Masters or
Doctoral degrees at the University.

### Useful information

* You must bring a laptop with working WiFi access.

* We will use [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/spul2023), a live
  collaborative note taking application. Etherpad is public, please use a
  pseudonym and do not reveal any personal information.

* We will be using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) to
  execute Python scripts and notebooks. *Please ensure that you can log on
  before the course starts*. I will also discuss the best ways to install and
  use Python on your own machine.

* Please make sure you can login to [wooclap](https://wooclap.com).

* Important course information will be communicated via the University Moodle.

### Outline

#### Session 1

1. Introduction
2. Getting started
3. Basics of Python
4. Array computations with numpy

#### Session 2

1. Array computations with numpy (cont.)
2. Plotting with matplotlib
3. Tabular data manipulation with pandas

#### Session 3 and 4

1. Tabular data manipulation with pandas (cont.)
2. Writing good quality and robust Python code

### Assessment

#### Doctoral candidates

A coursework will be distributed in the final class. To pass the course and
receive the ECTS credits you must complete the coursework.

#### Masters candidates

A coursework will be distributed in the final class. To pass the course and
receive the ECTS credits you must complete the coursework. The coursework will
be assessed on the basis of code clarity as discussed in Session 2 of the
course. I expect that most students will receive a good mark on the condition
that they submit a clear, correct and complete piece of coursework.

#### Attendance policy

This is a practical course and attendance is mandatory. A maximum of 2 TUs can
be missed across the semester. Further TUs missed will require a meeting with
the instructor and study programme director.

#### Retake policy

There is no retake possible - register for the course again at the next
available semester.
