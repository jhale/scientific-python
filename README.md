### Description

This four session course covers the basics of scientific programming with Python.
It is aimed at people who have done some programming before, perhaps on an
undergraduate course, but need a refresher before starting their Masters or
Doctoral degrees at the University.

### Useful information

* You must bring a laptop with working WiFi internet access.

* We will use [Etherpad](https://pad.carpentries.org/spul2022), a live
  collaborative note taking application. Etherpad is public, please use a
  pseudonym and do not reveal any personal information.

* We will be using [Google Colaboratory](https://colab.research.google.com) to
  execute Python scripts and notebooks. *Please ensure that you can log on
  before the course starts*. I will also discuss the best ways to install and
  use Python on your own machine.
