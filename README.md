## Doctoral Programme in Science and Engineering (DSSE)

### Practicalities

Instructor: Jack S. Hale (jack.hale@uni.lu). Office hours: 1500-1600 Wednesdays.
Dates:
* Tuesday 14th September 0900 - 1700.

### Description

This three day course covers the basics of scientific programming with Python.
It is aimed at people who have done some programming before, perhaps on an
undergraduate course, but need a refresher before starting their Masters or
Doctoral degrees at the University.

### Useful information

* This course is offered as "Level Up: Coding (Python)" in the Masters in
  Industrial Mathematics.

* The Etherpad for the 2021 edition is at: https://pad.carpentries.org/spul2021

* During the course we will be using Google Colab to execute Python scripts.
  *Please ensure that you can logon to https://colab.research.google.com/ before
  the course starts*. I will also discuss the best ways to install and use Python
  on your own machine.
